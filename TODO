how many exons in a gene
how many exons in a transcript

how many transcripts does a gene have? What are
the accessions of these transcripts?

What are the GRCh38 coordinates of the TSS of a
transcript (given the transcriptâ€™s accession provided
in the previous question)?

Which isoforms share an exon with a given
transcript

From a wetlab friend

What is the expression pattern of RAG1 in B-cell
development?

Which transcription factors control RAG1
expression? In which tissues
are those transcription factors expressed?

Which cell lines are used by ENCODE?
Show me the structure of the RAG1 locus.

Give me a list of genes coding for proteins on
chromosome X. (csv please?)

Give me a list of IncRNA potentially regulating the
MYC locus.

Show me all putative NMYC enhancers and overlap
the RNAseq for HepG2.
(or a tumor type)

And linking with GTEx for:

In which tissues is a gene expressed over X TPMs

What are the K tissues with the highest expression
of a gene / transcript
